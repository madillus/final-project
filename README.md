## Dynamic Restaurant Website using NextJS

Restaurants are not static businesses. They are very much dynamic and are constantly evolving,
growing and reinventing themselves to provide a consistent service to their patrons.
Menus being one of the most essential tools in any gastronomy related business need to be as dynamic as the business itself.

The goal of this is to allow for a much higher and simpler level of interaction between the proprietor and the website.
In turn allowing for a more seamless experience for the existing customers and a more inviting one for potential new ones.
When people visit a restaurant or bar, their first port of call is generally to search for it using their mobile phone,
so this will be heavily optimized for a clean and quick mobile experience.
